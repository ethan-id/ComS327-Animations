        Added openingScreen() method that plays a short intro animation welcoming the player and displaying the pokemon logo.

        Added HP bar logic that fills based on pokemon's current health / their max health
            added firstDigit() to help
    6:15am-6:45am
        Added encounterAnimation() that plays when encountering a pokemon in the wild
    4:00pm-6:23pm
        Updated pokemonBattle() to have a small animation before fighting a trainer
